## Website Scanner Tools (for all users)

> **Added:** 2026-03-30
> **Goal:** Build a set of website scanning tools in Dashboard that all authenticated users can access. Users input a URL, click Scan, and get a diagnostic report. Start with predefined logic (no LLM cost), optionally upgrade to LLM-enhanced summaries later.

### Phase 1 — Core Scanner (predefined logic, no LLM)

- [ ] Remove admin-only restriction on `/dashboard/tools` nav link
- [ ] Create `/dashboard/tools/scanner` page — unified Website Scanner UI
- [ ] **SEO Audit** — scan meta tags, title, h1 structure, og tags, canonical, sitemap.xml, robots.txt
- [ ] **AI Readiness** — check llms.txt, /.well-known/ai-plugin.json, schema markup, API endpoints, MCP server
- [ ] **Structured Data** — parse JSON-LD, microdata, Open Graph
- [ ] **Performance** — page size, image optimization, basic Core Web Vitals
- [ ] API route: `POST /api/v1/tools/scan` — accepts URL, returns structured results
- [ ] Rate limiting per user/organization (FREE plan: X scans/day)
- [ ] Results display as a scored report card with pass/fail per item

### Phase 2 — LLM-Enhanced Reports (optional upgrade)

- [ ] Send scan results to LLM for human-readable summary and improvement suggestions
- [ ] Store scan history per organization in database (new Prisma model)
- [ ] Compare scans over time (before/after improvements)

### Phase 3 — Community Features

- [ ] AI Tools Directory — browsable list of AI tools
- [ ] User submissions — authenticated users can submit tools for review
- [ ] Admin approval workflow for submitted tools
